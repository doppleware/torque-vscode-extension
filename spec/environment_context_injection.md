# Environment Context Injection Specification

## Product Purpose

The environment context injection feature enables developers to seamlessly bring live environment data into their AI-assisted development conversations. When working with Torque environments, developers can instantly access comprehensive environment information within their VS Code AI chat sessions.

## User Experience Requirements

### One-Click Environment Context

**Requirement**: Developers must be able to add environment context to their AI chat with a single click or link.

- Environment context is accessible through special URLs that work from anywhere (web browsers, emails, documentation)
- Clicking an environment link automatically opens VS Code and adds the environment data to the current AI chat session
- No manual copying, pasting, or navigation required
- Works seamlessly whether VS Code is already open or needs to be launched

### Universal URL Format

**Requirement**: Environment context URLs must be simple, predictable, and work from any source.

- URL format: `vscode://quali.torque-ai/chat/context/add/environment/{SPACE_NAME}/{ENVIRONMENT_ID}`
- URLs work when clicked from web browsers, email clients, documentation, or messaging apps
- Special characters in space names and environment IDs are handled automatically
- URLs are human-readable and can be constructed programmatically or manually

### Seamless AI Chat Integration

**Requirement**: Environment data must be immediately available in AI chat sessions without disrupting the user's workflow.

- Environment data is automatically attached to the current AI chat session
- If no chat session is active, one is opened automatically
- Data is provided in a format optimized for AI analysis and conversation
- Users receive confirmation that environment context has been added

### Rich Environment Information

**Requirement**: Injected environment context must provide comprehensive, actionable information about the environment.

Environment data includes:

- Environment ownership and collaboration details
- Current status and configuration information
- Cost tracking and resource utilization
- Connection and dependency information
- Historical usage and performance data
- Security and access control settings
- Workflow and automation status

## Functional Requirements

### URL Handling

**Automatic Environment Detection**

- Extension automatically recognizes environment context URLs
- Space names and environment IDs are extracted from URLs correctly
- URL encoding and special characters are handled transparently
- Invalid or malformed URLs provide clear error messages

### Data Retrieval

**Real-Time Environment Data**

- Environment information is fetched directly from the Torque platform
- Data is always current and reflects the latest environment state
- Authentication is handled transparently using stored credentials
- Network issues are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Context Attachment

**AI Chat Integration**

- Environment data is packaged as a structured file attachment for AI analysis
- Data format is optimized for natural language processing and analysis
- AI can easily reference environment details in responses and recommendations
- Multiple environment contexts can be added to the same chat session

### Error Handling

**Graceful Failure Management**

- Authentication issues provide clear guidance for credential updates
- Network connectivity problems offer helpful troubleshooting steps
- Missing or inaccessible environments are reported with specific error details
- Partial failures don't prevent other extension functionality from working

## User Workflow Examples

### From Torque Web Dashboard

1. User is viewing an environment in their Torque web dashboard
2. User clicks "Analyze in VS Code" or similar action
3. VS Code opens (or focuses if already open)
4. Environment context is automatically added to AI chat
5. User can immediately ask AI questions about the environment

### From Documentation or Email

1. User receives an email or documentation containing an environment context URL
2. User clicks the URL link
3. VS Code launches and opens AI chat with environment context loaded
4. User can analyze the environment or ask questions without additional setup

### From Manual URL Construction

1. Developer constructs an environment context URL following the standard format
2. URL can be shared with team members or embedded in documentation
3. Anyone with access can click the URL to load environment context
4. Enables easy collaboration and knowledge sharing around specific environments

## Success Criteria

### Usability Metrics

- Users can access environment context in under 5 seconds from any source
- 95% of environment context URLs work correctly on first attempt
- No training or documentation required for basic URL usage
- Environment data is complete and immediately useful for AI analysis

### Integration Quality

- Environment context enhances AI conversations with relevant, actionable information
- AI can effectively analyze and provide insights based on environment data
- Multiple environment contexts can be managed within a single chat session
- Context injection doesn't interfere with other VS Code or AI chat functionality

### Reliability Requirements

- Environment context URLs work consistently across different browsers and email clients
- Data retrieval succeeds reliably even for complex environment configurations
- Authentication and authorization are handled transparently
- Error conditions provide sufficient information for user self-service resolution

### Performance Standards

- Environment context is available within 3 seconds of URL activation
- Data retrieval doesn't block or slow down VS Code interface
- Large environment datasets are handled efficiently
- Multiple concurrent context requests are processed smoothly
