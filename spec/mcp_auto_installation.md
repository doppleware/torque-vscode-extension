# MCP Auto-Installation Specification

## Product Purpose

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) auto-installation feature provides developers with immediate access to Torque AI capabilities within VS Code's native AI chat interface. This eliminates manual setup steps and ensures that Torque AI tools are automatically available when developers configure their credentials.

## User Experience Requirements

### Zero-Configuration AI Tool Access

**Requirement**: Once users configure their Torque credentials, AI tools must be automatically available without additional setup.

- Torque AI tools appear automatically in VS Code's AI chat interface after credential configuration
- No manual server registration, file editing, or additional installation steps required
- Tools are immediately functional and ready for use in AI conversations
- Users receive confirmation when tools become available

### Seamless AI Chat Integration

**Requirement**: Torque AI capabilities must feel like native VS Code AI features rather than third-party add-ons.

- Torque tools appear alongside other AI tools in VS Code's standard AI interface
- Tool descriptions and parameters are clearly presented in VS Code's native UI
- Tool execution and results display using VS Code's standard AI chat patterns
- No visual distinction between Torque tools and built-in AI capabilities

### Automatic Credential Management

**Requirement**: Tool authentication must be handled transparently using the user's configured Torque credentials.

- Tools automatically use the API credentials configured during extension setup
- No separate authentication or token management required for AI tools
- Credential updates immediately apply to all AI tool functionality
- Authentication failures provide clear guidance for credential resolution

### Intelligent Tool Discovery

**Requirement**: VS Code must automatically recognize and register Torque AI tools when they become available.

- Tool registration occurs immediately when valid credentials are configured
- VS Code's AI system automatically discovers newly available Torque tools
- Tool availability is verified and validated before presentation to users
- Unavailable or misconfigured tools are handled gracefully without user disruption

## Available AI Tools

### Environment Analysis Tool

**Purpose**: Enables AI to analyze Torque environments and provide insights about infrastructure, costs, and configurations.

**User Experience**:

- Users can ask AI to analyze specific environments by name or ID
- AI receives comprehensive environment data including status, costs, resources, and dependencies
- AI can provide recommendations based on environment configuration and usage patterns
- Results include actionable insights about optimization, security, and best practices

**Example Interactions**:

- "Analyze the production environment costs and suggest optimizations"
- "What security risks exist in the staging environment configuration?"
- "Compare resource usage between development and production environments"

### Code-Environment Correlation Tool

**Purpose**: Helps AI understand relationships between code changes and environment impacts.

**User Experience**:

- AI can correlate code changes with environment performance and behavior
- Users can ask about the impact of proposed code changes on specific environments
- AI provides insights about deployment risks and environment compatibility
- Results help developers make informed decisions about code deployment strategies

## Functional Requirements

### Automatic Registration Process

**Credential-Triggered Activation**

- Tool registration occurs automatically when both API URL and token are configured
- Registration status is validated and confirmed before tools become available
- Registration failures are handled gracefully with appropriate error messaging
- Tool availability is monitored and maintained throughout the VS Code session

### Tool Definition and Metadata

**Comprehensive Tool Information**

- Each tool includes clear descriptions of its purpose and capabilities
- Parameter requirements are clearly defined and validated
- Tool responses are formatted for optimal AI conversation integration
- Tool metadata enables VS Code to present appropriate usage guidance

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Graceful Degradation**

- Authentication issues disable tools temporarily without affecting other extension features
- Network connectivity problems are handled with appropriate retry logic
- Invalid tool responses are processed gracefully with helpful error information
- Tool failures don't interrupt or crash AI chat sessions

### Performance and Reliability

**Responsive Tool Execution**

- Tool operations complete within reasonable timeframes (typically under 10 seconds)
- Long-running operations provide progress feedback to users
- Tool execution doesn't block or slow down the VS Code interface
- Multiple concurrent tool operations are handled efficiently

## User Workflow Examples

### Daily Development Usage

1. User opens VS Code AI chat interface
2. Torque tools are visible and available alongside other AI capabilities
3. User asks AI questions that leverage Torque environment data
4. AI uses Torque tools automatically to provide comprehensive responses
5. Results include both AI analysis and live Torque environment information

### Credential Updates

1. User updates Torque credentials through extension settings
2. MCP tools are automatically re-registered with new credentials
3. Tool availability is confirmed and users are notified
4. AI functionality continues seamlessly with updated authentication
