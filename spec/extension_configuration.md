# Extension Configuration Specification

## Product Purpose

The Torque AI VS Code extension enables developers to seamlessly integrate Torque observability insights directly into their development workflow. Users need a simple, secure way to connect their local VS Code environment to their Torque platform instance.

## User Experience Requirements

### Initial Setup Experience

**Requirement**: First-time users must be able to configure the extension in under 2 minutes with minimal technical knowledge.

- Users are guided through a simple setup wizard when the extension is first installed
- The setup process requires only two pieces of information: their Torque platform URL and an API token
- Users receive clear, non-technical instructions for each step
- The setup wizard validates inputs in real-time to prevent configuration errors

### Configuration Information Required

**Requirement**: Users must provide their Torque platform connection details to enable full functionality.

- **Torque Platform URL**: The web address where their Torque platform is hosted (e.g., https://company.qtorque.io)
- **API Token**: A secure token obtained from their Torque platform account for authentication

### Security and Privacy

**Requirement**: User credentials must be stored securely and never exposed in plain text.

- API tokens are stored using VS Code's built-in secure credential storage
- Tokens are never displayed in logs, console output, or error messages
- All communication with Torque platforms occurs over encrypted HTTPS connections
- Users have full control over their stored credentials and can update or remove them at any time

### Configuration Management

**Requirement**: Users can easily update their configuration settings and verify their connection status.

- A dedicated "Configure Torque AI" command is available in VS Code's command palette
- Users can check their connection status through a "Check Torque AI Status" command
- Configuration changes take effect immediately without requiring VS Code restart
- Clear error messages guide users when configuration issues occur

### Onboarding Support

**Requirement**: Users understand how to obtain and configure their credentials without external support.

- Setup wizard provides links to Torque platform documentation for obtaining API tokens
- Built-in validation ensures users enter correctly formatted URLs and tokens
- Success confirmation messages clearly indicate when setup is complete
- Setup failure messages provide specific, actionable guidance for resolution

## Functional Requirements

### Setup Wizard Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: Brief explanation of what the extension does and what information is needed
2. **URL Configuration**: User enters their Torque platform URL with real-time validation
3. **Token Configuration**: User enters their API token with secure, masked input
4. **Validation**: Extension verifies the connection works with the provided credentials
5. **Completion**: Success message confirms setup and explains next steps

### Configuration Validation

- URL format must be valid (http:// or https://) and accessible
- API token must be non-empty and authenticate successfully with the Torque platform
- Connection testing occurs during setup to catch configuration issues early
- Users receive immediate feedback about configuration problems

### Error Handling

- Network connectivity issues are clearly explained with suggested solutions
- Invalid credentials produce helpful error messages without exposing security details
- Configuration problems don't prevent VS Code from functioning normally
- Users can retry configuration without losing previously entered information

### Multi-Environment Support

- Users working with multiple Torque environments can easily switch configurations
- Configuration settings are stored per VS Code workspace when appropriate
- Global configuration serves as default for new workspaces

## Success Criteria

### User Onboarding Success

- 90% of users complete initial setup within 3 minutes
- Users can successfully connect to their Torque platform on first attempt
- No technical support tickets related to basic configuration issues

### Ongoing Usage

- Configuration persists reliably across VS Code sessions and updates
- Users can update their configuration without losing other extension data
- Connection issues are diagnosed and resolved through the extension interface

### Security Compliance

- No credential information is ever exposed in plain text
- All credential storage meets enterprise security requirements
- Users can confidently use the extension in corporate environments
